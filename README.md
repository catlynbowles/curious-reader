## Abstract

- Curious Reader is built with TypeScript in the React.js framework. It takes inspiration from popular book applications such as _npr.org_ and _reesesbookclub.com_. Our application is built for users that are wanting to find some awesome new books to read or check out from the most recent _New York Times Best Sellers_ lists. Upon page load, the user is greeted by a page containing the number 1 books from each genre. There is also a navigation bar that allows users to navigate to the top ranked books for each genre. Welcome all Curious Readers!

## Technology Stack

- CSS
- Cypress.io
- Fetch API
- Postman
- React.js
- React Router
- TypeScript

## Features

- A user can navigate to the homepage that previews the book genres with the top book from each category. 

- A user can select different book genres, which filters the books and book details displayed based on genre. 

- From a genre page, a user can go back to the homepage where I can select a different genre of books to see. 

## Context and Features

- Curious Reader is a React.js application with a TypeScript basis. As such, it required thorough type checking of API data, and properties that were being passed around from our application state to other components. Given the design and data structure of our application, it made the most sense for my collaborators and I to make an interfaces file. The interfaces were designed to be reusable type checks for our data. This allowed us to import said types wherever we needed them throughout our component architecture. We kept our typing strict on our data sets which allowed us to develop our application without any type errors. 

- Aside from TypeScript, one of the primary features of our application is the ability to see the top books from each specific genre. This took some very careful page and endpoint manipulation using React Router. Our `Navbar` component contains every genre from _The New York Times Best Sellers_ lists. Each genre in the `Navbar` component is a `NavLink` that navigates to the respective genre page `Route`. We made use of a `useState()` React hook and a `useEffect()` hook. These two hooks allowed us to maintain state for all of our genre pages dynamically. 

## Lessons Learned

- This was a Stretch Technology project. What that meant for me and my collaborators is that we had to teach ourselves TypeScript in order to build this application. It was the first time that most of us had had exposure to writing TypeScript, and the type checking involved in a React application. We made use of many resources online including but not limited to TypeScript docs, React docs, courses, walkthroughs, and video tutorials. This in combination with our prior experience writing code in JavaScript and React JSX made learning TypeScript a welcome and manageable challenge. This was our first time incorporating React hooks into a project as well. Coming from using class components, and incorporating the `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks was an exciting addition for us. It’ll likely influence how we approach state in our future applications. 

## Future Features

Some future features we’d like to add to this application are:

- Add a search/filtering functionality for books.

- Have individual book detail pages for each book on the list.

- Random book suggestion game. 

- Searching for books based on the date they were published in _The New York Times Best Sellers_ lists.

- Supplement our Cypress tests with unit tests and integration tests by using the React Testing Library.

## Application Set-Up

1. Fork repository on GitHub.

2. `Git clone` the repository to your local machine.

4. `Cd` into the directory.

5. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install project dependencies.

6. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the application. 

7. Run `npm run cypress` in the terminal  to run cypress tests. 

8. When finished with the application, type `Control + C` in the terminal to stop running the application.
